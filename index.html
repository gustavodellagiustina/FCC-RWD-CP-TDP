        <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the Web. It defines the meaning and structure of web content. Other technologies besides HTML are generally used to describe a web page's appearance/presentation (CSS) or functionality/behavior (JavaScript).</p>
        <p>"Hypertext" refers to links that connect web pages to one another, either within a single website or between websites. Links are a fundamental aspect of the Web. By uploading content to the Internet and linking it to pages created by other people, you become an active participant in the World Wide Web.</p>
        <code>The HTML element isn't self-contained.</code>
        <ul><li>Therefore, you need to enclose it within opening ("<>") and closing ("<>"" + "/" in between) tags.</li></ul>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="#CSS#">
        <header>#CSS#</header>
        <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS describes how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media.</p>
        <p>CSS is among the core languages of the open web and is standardized across Web browsers according to W3C specifications. Previously, the development of various parts of CSS specification was done synchronously, which allowed the versioning of the latest recommendations. You might have heard about CSS1, CSS2.1, or even CSS3. There will never be a CSS3 or a CSS4; rather, everything is now CSS without a version number.</p>
        <code>The id selector hold only one value.</code>
        <ul><li>Meanwhile, the class selector can hold more than one.</li></ul>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="(JavaScript)">
        <header>(JavaScript)</header>
        <p>JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class functions. While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles.</p>
        <p>JavaScript's dynamic capabilities include runtime object construction, variable parameter lists, function variables, dynamic script creation (via eval), object introspection (via for...in and Object utilities), and source-code recovery (JavaScript functions store their source text and can be retrieved through toString()).</p>
        <code>If your function is declared with at least one argument or parameter...</code>
        <ul><li>...don't forget to pass it when you call her, otherwise it won't work.</li></ul>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id=".DOM.">
        <header>.DOM.</header>
        <p>The DOM (Document Object Model) is an API that represents and interacts with any HTML or XML document. The DOM is a document model loaded in the browser and representing the document as a node tree, where each node represents part of the document (e.g. an element, text string, or comment).</p>
        <p>The DOM is one of the most-used APIs on the Web because it allows code running in a browser to access and interact with every node in the document. Nodes can be created, moved and changed. Event listeners can be added to nodes and triggered on occurrence of a given event.</p>
        <code>Store DOM nodes in variables for greater convenience.</code>
        <ul><li>Here's an example: "allH2Elements = document.getElementsByTagName("h2")" -- without the quotes -- returns a NodeList of the >h2< elements in the document, which, like an array, is zero-indexed.</li></ul>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="!Accessibility!">
        <header>!Accessibility!</header>
        <p>Accessibility (often abbreviated to A11y â€” as in, "a", then 11 characters, and then "y") in web development means enabling as many people as possible to use websites, even when those people's abilities are limited in some way.</p>
        <p>For many people, technology makes things easier. For people with disabilities, technology makes things possible. Accessibility means developing content to be as accessible as possible, no matter an individual's physical and cognitive abilities and how they access the web.</p>
        <code>Keep in mind the different kind os special needs many people have when interacting online.</code>
        <ul><li>This includes problems with (among other kinds of senses difficulties): vision, tact, hearing...</li></ul>
